- select-all-presentations-alike-at-point: command for selecting all presentations with the same type as the one at point in the buffer.
- implement filtered selection of presentations. the user can select a predicate to use for selecting from a list of presentations.
- select marked text as a presentation. for example, parse some text and create a date, path, etc. when enabled, select-presentation-at-point could fall back to select marked text as presentation, when there's marked text.
- command to reverse the order of selected presentations?
- consider implementing an interaction mode in which a command is selected first, and then its arguments are filled by selecting matching presentations after, like in CLIM.
- consider the possibility of adding options to commands, and let the user select them before running (look at magit-popup library!).
- consider adding a multiplicity option to parameters in commands. for example, (users user :multiple t).
- consider adding an ordered option to commands, that indicates if the command parameters should come in order or not for it to match.
- IDEA: updating presentations. Presentations that listen to some event and redisplay when a change occurs.
- IMPLEMENT UNIT TESTS!!
- Write a TexInfo manual.
- Package and ship accordingly.
