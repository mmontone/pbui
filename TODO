- select-all-presentations-alike-at-point: command for selecting all presentations with the same type as the one at point in the buffer.
- implement filtered selection of presentations. the user can select a predicate to use for selecting from a list of presentations.
- make global minor mode global (fix)
- make presentation mode appear in modeline and modeline menu.
- command that opens popup buffer with currently selected presentations
- select marked text as a presentation. for example, parse some text and create a date, path, etc. when enabled, select-presentation-at-point could fall back to select marked text as presentation, when there's marked text.
- command to reverse the order of selected presentations?
- consider implementing an interaction mode in which a command is selected first, and then its arguments are filled by selecting matching presentations after, like in CLIM.
- consider the possibility of adding options to commands, and let the user select them before running. inspire in magit commands. (this could be useful as an independt library perhaps.)
- consider adding a multiplicity option to parameters in commands. for example, (users user :multiple t).
- consider adding an ordered option to commands, that indicates if the command parameters should come in order or not for it to match.
- consider implementing two different presentations modes:
   - presentations-mode: highlights presentations for cursor and mouse. Doesn't implement specific key bindings.
   - modal-presentations-mode: presentations-mode + modal key bindings.
that would allow three interaction models:
   - no presentation mode: interact with global presentation key bindings. no buffer visual feedback apart from selected presentations.
   - presentations-mode: visual feedback.
   - modal-presentations-mode: visual feedback and presentations specific interaction.
- IDEA: updating presentations. Presentations that listen to some event and redisplay when a change occurs.
